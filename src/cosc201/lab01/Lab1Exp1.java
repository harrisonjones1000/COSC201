/**
 * Lab 1, Experiment 1
 * 
 * a. What is the (typical) ratio between the time taken for sum(1000) 
 *    and sum(100)? Does that make sense? What \textit{should} the ratio be?
 * b. How large do you need to make $n$ before the ratio between the time 
 *    taken for sum(10*n) and sum(n) approaches what it should be? When you
 *    reach that point, how much total time (roughly) is being used?
 * c. What does this say about the design of wall-clock experiments to test 
 *    efficiency?
